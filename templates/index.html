    Retirement and financial independence can often seem like nothing more than
    a pipe dream for the average person. If you have an extremely low or a zero
    savings rate, you will likely have to work for the rest of your life just
    to survive.
    <br>
    <br>
    Fortunately, the inverse is also true. The higher your savings rate, the
    faster you can retire.

    How much faster? All other things being equal (salary, rate of return,
    etc.), if you save 15% of your income you'll be able to retire in about 42
    years. If you save 50% of your income, you can retire in under 17 years -

                        color1="#10aa10",
                        income1=100000,
                        expenses1=50000,
                        rexpenses1=50000,
                        networth1=0,
                        name2="15%Savings",
                        color2="#fc0600",
                        income2=100000,
                        expenses2=85000,
                        rexpenses2=85000,
                        networth2=0,
                       ) }}'>
      a difference of 25 years!
    </a>

    How is this possible? The math works out this way for two reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The higher your savings rate, the more money you can invest each year
        for retirement. The more money you invest, the faster your nest egg
        will grow.
      </li>
      <li>
        The higher your savings rate, the less you spend. The less you spend,
        the smaller your nest egg needs to be in order to retire.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Increasing your income can also increase your savings rate, but for equal
    amounts it is not as effective. A 5% increase in income will do less for
    your retirement date than a 5% decrease in spending will.

    When can <b>you</b> retire? I've made the following calculator for just
    that purpose! Using only your current annual income, expenses, and few
    other numbers, you can plot a course to retirement. You can even calculate
    multiple scenarios at once if you're curious what, for example, saving an
    additional 10% of your income or picking up an extra shift at work will do
    for your retirement date.
